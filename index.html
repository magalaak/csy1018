                <p>
                    The National Birds maintains the third largest bird collection in the world with over 625,000 specimens. 
                    Our National Birds Collection has representatives of about 80% of the approximately 9600 known species in the world's avifauna. 
                    The collection is comprised of specimens primarily prepared as study skins, skeletons, fluid preserved, eggs, nests, and mounted skins. We also hold nearly 4000 primary type specimens.
                    Ornithology is the study of birds. Birds are distinguished from other living vertebrates by three things: feathers, hollow bones, and hard shelled eggs. 
                    Birds are found worldwide, and roughly 10,000 species are known to exist. Ornithological research encompasses many branches, including taxonomy, evolution, anatomy, ecology, conservation biology and wildlife management. 
                    The National Birds Collection serves the research community through the research of our scientists and stewardship of the bird collections.

                <p> My name is Saidu Samura, I was born in Freetown, Sierra Leone. When I was 8 years old I moved to The Netherlands. After living there for 12 years, I moved to the UK. I enjoy the course that I am doing currently, especially networking. Also, I have been doing for quite a long time. 
                    Firstly, I started doing computing in the secondary school and since then Iâ€™ve been doing it up till now. What I like about computer science the most is the fact that there is so much to learn. I find this interesting because you will have something to do a research on. 
                    In my spare time I enjoy playing football, video games and doing researches on the web.
