        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>


        <p>My name is Saidu Samura, I was born in Freetown, Sierra Leone. When I was 8 years old I moved to The
            Netherlands. After living there for 12 years, I moved to the UK. I enjoy the course that I am doing
            currently, especially networking. Also, I have been doing for quite a long time. Firstly, I started doing
            computing in the secondary school and since then I’ve been doing it up till now. What I like about computer
            science the most is the fact that there is so much to learn. I find this interesting because you will have
            something to do a research on. In my spare time I enjoy playing football, video games and doing researches
            on the web.

        <h2>What is the purpose?</h2>
        <p>It appears that people don’t always get the right idea about what network engineers do. The idea that people
            get is that the engineers just sit down behind the desk and just monitor the network. The purpose of this
            website is to show what happens behind closed doors and most importantly, to make sure the audience learn
            and get more knowledge about this. </p>
