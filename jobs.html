        <h1>Network Engineer VS System Engineer</h1>
       
        What are the responsibilities?
        While system engineers develop and maintain computer networks for companies, network engineers work on and
        troubleshoot these systems. Besides this main difference, the day-to-day responsibilities of these two
        positions are quite similar. Both roles must understand network security, how to fix issues, and handle changes
        and updates. Both of these engineers must have sharp written and verbal communication skills, as they often
        work in teams.
       
        <h3>Network Engineer</h3> 
        
        Network engineers integrate and troubleshoot an employer's computer network system. Network engineers must have
        a deep understanding of networking technology, such as routing, DNS servers, and cryptographic tunnelling, as
        well as common software, such as Microsoft Office. A bachelor's degree in information technology or computer
        science is commonly required, though previous experience may make up for a lack of education. Strong
        communication skills are important, as network engineers may work in teams or have to explain complex network
        issues to those without computing backgrounds. These engineers generally work in an office and may be required
        to travel if their employer has multiple locations.
        
        <h4>System Engineer</h4>
        
        System engineers are the architects of computer systems for their clients or employers. These computer experts
        work with a team of engineers, administrators, and programmers to create these complex systems. In some cases,
        they may reconfigure existing computer systems to meet the desires of their employer. Creating these systems
        takes a great deal of teamwork, so sharp communication skills are necessary. A bachelor's degree in
        engineering, information technology, or computer science is often required.
