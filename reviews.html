    <h2>Experience of network engineer</h2>

    <p>In my last 16 years with BT, a typical day at work in operations involved periods of intense activity when
        dealing with a major fault, but dealing with general fault tickets was more relaxed, and team members supported
        each other when needed. I learned to fault and repair many different routers and switches, and understand the
        transmission network that supported them.
        The management team were supportive and approachable, and breaks could be taken when you liked, providing your
        absence was not advesely affecting the team.
        The hardest part of the job was dealing with increasingly complicated networks, when training involved just a
        couple of hours' Powerpoint presentation.

        When I first signed up for the Telecommunications course in University, nobody prepared me for the kind of
        job I amm signing up to adopt for the rest of my life.
        Do not get me wrong, I love being a network engineer, but back in the beginnings of my career, I was crying
        for help.
        I was cursing the moment I decided to pursue a career in this domain and felt completely hopeless.
        Ah, those days.
        Although I had multiple chances to just give up and become a doctor or something, it has never been in my
        blood to quit.
        So, I took the challenge: shift life, network problems I never heard of and of course, following the
        weather cast.
        Daily.
        A lot of my friends had no idea what a network engineer does for life. And after many visual explaining
        sessions, they still do not.
        So, I this post is for them and everyone who wants to know what the professional life of a network engineer
        is like.

        <h3>Network Engineers Never Sleep</h3>
        Well not literally. Networks and data centres need constant monitoring, as the main source of problems that
        may disrupt their stability is very unpredictable.
        The environments that use NOCs need very high and stable availability, usually meaning uptime – much higher
        than normal.
        Keeping in mind that the source of problems for networks is often the weather, power outage,
        human element and incompatible network changes that often are not evaluated properly and cause severe
        incidents – it is only expected for a NOC to operate 24/7/365.
        You may think that a network problem can not be that big of a deal if it is not predicted and stopped on
        time,
        so let me just roughly visualize the horror a network failure can bring to companies:

        • An entire fleet of airplanes can be grounded urgently because of a data centre problem. Delta Airlines is
        an example;
        • A one-day service outage at Salesforce.com cost the company $20 milion.
        • A series of delays and slowdowns from the Bank of America’s website that lasted for 6 consecutive days,
        affected 29 million online customers – not so good for the Bank’s image nor for its operations.

        Conclusion: if the network does not sleep, neither do we. Welcome to the life of a network engineer.
        Having said this, working in shifts means going to work in the middle of the night and coming home at dawn
        or even when the day has long begun.
        Also, all your neighbours are gone to work.
        Sometimes it is like everyone else his work day: a 9-5 job. And sometimes, you’re left with just a few
        hours at night to see your loved ones, grab a bite and crush in bed.
        But that is just shift life.
