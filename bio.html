                    <h2>Why Evolution Goes Wild On Islands: The Science Of Adaptive Radiation</h2>
                    <p> Normally, bird identification begins by mentally assessing similarities to other familiar birds. For example, is it a finch, tanager, wren, or sparrow? 
                        Experience allows for an educated guess and turning right to the relevant section of a field guide where the unknown bird’s likely family is illustrated.
                        But there are places in the world where even very closely related birds look incredibly different from one another. 
                        For example, on the Galápagos Islands one bird species might look like a warbler, another like a grosbeak, and a third like no other bird on the planet. 
                        Yet despite their different shapes, sizes, and colours, these three birds are all in the same family—close descendants of the same avian ancestor.
                        The process that creates these many different forms stemming from the same original bird is called “adaptive radiation,” and it has confounded past generations of seasoned naturalists and expert ornithologists. 
                        Yet however perplexing, a deeper look at adaptive radiations reveals that these birds are wondrous examples of the power of evolution to create new forms. Among the most spectacular extremes of bird evolution, these explosions of avian diversity are worth understanding, celebrating, and conserving.
