            <h2>Image & multimedia</h2>HTML supports various multimedia resources such as images, audio, and video.


            <p>o "area" - The HTML "area" element defines a hot-spot region on an image, and optionally associates it
                with a hypertext link. This element is used only within a "map" element.</p>

            <p> o "audio" - The HTML "audio" element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or
                more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the "source" element: the browser will
                choose the most suitable one. It can also be the destination for streamed media, using a MediaStream.</p>

            <p> "img" - The HTML "img" element embeds an image into the document. It is a replaced element.</p>

            <p> "map" - The HTML "map" element is used with "area" elements to define an image map (a clickable link
                area).</p>

            <p>"track" - The HTML "track" element is used as a child of the media elements "audio" and "video". It
                lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles.
                The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files) — Web Video Text Tracks or Timed Text Markup
                Language (TTML).</p>

            <p>"video" - The HTML Video element ("video") embeds a media player which supports video playback into the
            document.</p>




           <h2>Embedded content</h2>


            In addition to regular multimedia content, HTML can include a variety of other content, even if it's not
            always easy to interact with.</p> 


           <p>o "applet" - The obsolete HTML Applet Element ("applet") embeds a Java applet into the document; this
            element has been deprecated in favor of "object".</p> 

            <p>o "embed" - The HTML "embed" element embeds external content at the specified point in the document. This
            content is provided by an external application or other source of interactive content such as a browser
            plug-in.</p>

            <p>o "iframe" - The HTML Inline Frame element ("iframe") represents a nested browsing context, effectively
            embedding another HTML page into the current page.</p>

            <p>o "noembed" - The "noembed" element is an obsolete, non-standard way to provide alternative, or "fallback",
            content for browsers that do not support the "embed" element or do not support the type of embedded content
            an author wishes to use.</p>

            <p>o "object" - The HTML "object" element represents an external resource, which can be treated as an image, a
            nested browsing context, or a resource to be handled by a plugin.</p>

           <p> o "param" - The HTML "param" element defines parameters for an "object" element.</p>

            <p>o "picture" - The HTML "picture" element contains zero or more "source" elements and one "img" element to
            provide versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.</p>

           <p> o "source" - The HTML "source" element specifies multiple media resources for the "picture", the "audio"
            element, or the "video" element. It is an empty element. It is commonly used to serve the same media
            content in multiple formats supported by different browsers.</p>

            <h2>Scripting</h2>


            In order to create dynamic content and Web applications, HTML supports the use of scripting languages, most
            prominently JavaScript. Certain elements support this capability.</p>


           <p>o "canvas" - Use the HTML "canvas" element with either the canvas scripting API or the WebGL API to draw
            graphics and animations.</p> 

            <p> o "noscript" - The HTML "noscript" element defines a section of HTML to be inserted if a script type on the
            page is unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser.</p>

            <p>o "script" - The HTML "script" element is used to embed or reference executable code; this is typically
            used to embed or refer to JavaScript code.</p>

            <h5>Demarcating edits</h5>


            <p>These elements let you provide indications that specific parts of the text have been altered.</p>


            <P> "del" - The HTML "del" element represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document.</P>
            <p> "ins" - The HTML "ins" element represents a range of text that has been added to a document.</p>



            <h2>Table content</h2>


            <p>The elements here are used to create and handle tabular data.</p>


            <p> "caption" - The HTML Table Caption element ("caption") specifies the caption (or title) of a table, and
            if used is always the first child of a "table".</p>

            <p> "col" - The HTML "col" element defines a column within a table and is used for defining common semantics
            on all common cells. It is generally found within a "colgroup" element.</p>

            <p>"colgroup" - The HTML "colgroup" element defines a group of columns within a table.</p> 

            <p>o "table" - The HTML "table" element represents tabular data — that is, information presented in a
            two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data.</p>

            <p> "tbody" - The HTML Table Body element ("tbody") encapsulates a set of table row ("tr" elements),
            indicating that they comprise the body of the table ("table").</p>

            <p> "td" - The HTML "td" element defines a cell of a table that contains data. It participates in the table
            model.</p>

            <p> "tfoot" - The HTML "tfoot" element defines a set of rows summarizing the columns of the table.</p>

            <p> "th" - The HTML "th" element defines a cell as header of a group of table cells. The exact nature of this
            group is defined by the scope and headers attributes.</p>

            <p> "thead" - The HTML "thead" element defines a set of rows defining the head of the columns of the table.</p>

            <p>o "tr" - The HTML "tr" element defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can then be established
            using a mix of "td" (data cell) and "th" (header cell) elements.The HTML "tr" element specifies that the
            markup contained inside the "tr" block comprises one row of a table, inside which the "th" and "td"
            elements create header and data cells, respectively, within the row.</p>

            <h2>Forms</h2>


            <p>HTML provides a number of elements which can be used together to create forms which the user can fill out
            and submit to the
            Web site or application. There's a great deal of further information about this available in the HTML forms
            guide.</p>

            available for other controls.</p>

            <p>o "input" - The HTML "input" element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to
            accept data from the user; a wide variety of types of input data and control widgets are available,

            <p> o "option" - The HTML "option" element is used to define an item contained in a "select", an "optgroup", or

            HTML document.</p>

            <p> o "output" - The HTML Output element ("output") is a container element into which a site or app can inject

            <h2>Web Components</h2>


            <p> Web Components is an HTML-related technology which makes it possible to, essentially, create and use custom

            <p>o "content" - The HTML "content" element - an obsolete part of the Web Components suite of technologies -
            was used inside of Shadow DOM as an insertion point, and wasn't meant to be used in ordinary HTML.</p>

            <p> o "element" - The obsolete HTML "element" element was part of the Web Components specification; it was
            intended to be used to define new custom DOM elements.</p>

            <p>o "shadow" - The HTML "shadow" element - an obsolete part of the Web Components technology suite - was
            intended to be used as a shadow DOM insertion point.</p>

            <p> o "slot" - The HTML "slot" element - part of the Web Components technology suite - is a placeholder inside
            a web component that you can fill with your own markup, which lets you create separate DOM trees and
            present them together.</p>

            <p>o "template" - The HTML Content Template ("template") element is a mechanism for holding client-side
            content that is not to be rendered when a page is loaded but may subsequently be instantiated during
